  <h1>Timothy's Café's Recipes</h1>

  <p>I adapted this recipe from a book called <a href="sydney.html" target="_blank">Sydney Food</a>  by Bill Grainger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1st visit to Bill's restaurant in King's Cross, these eggs have been the best eggs I have ever tasted</p>

<p>This recipe is what I call a "very speical breakfast"; just look at the ingredients to see you. It has to be tasted to belive</p>  

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>The following ingredients make one serving:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon of butter (10g)</li>
  <li>1/3 cup of cream (Two 3/4 fl ounces)</li>
  <li>A pinch of salt</li>
  <li>Freshly milled black pepper</li>
  <li>3 fresh chives (chopped)</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Whisk eggs, cream, and salt in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Melt the butter in a non-stick pan over a high heat (<i>taking care not to burn the butter</i>).</li>
    <li>Pour egg mixture into a pan and wait until it starts setting around the edge of the pan (around 20 seconds).</li>
    <li>Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center as if it were an omlet, and let it cook for another 20 secinds</li>
    <li>Fold contents in again, leave for 20 seconds, and repeat until eggs are only just done.</li>
    <li>Grind a light sprinkling of freshly milled pepper over the eggs and blend in some chopped fresh chives</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You should only make a maximum of two servings per frying pan</p>
